# Web Media Porting spec (deprecated)

This repository was intended to contain a Web Media Porting/Integration specification. The [Web Media API Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webmediaapi) did the initial work to gather a set of [issues](https://github.com/w3c/webmediaporting/issues) around integrating Web Media APIs.

Although the specification was never developed, the issues gathered are still relevant, so we are keeping the repository open in case someone wishes to use them to produce a document that addresses them.
